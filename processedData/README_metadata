The metadata were heavily wrangled. For details see the "wrangling*" scripts. Note that wrangling for this project was very challenging due to the disparate data sources and modifications needed for various samples for quality control. 

Sample labeling follows this convention: digit_digit_digit_digit_compartment

Where the first digit is the region sampled, the second is the site within the region, the third is
the plant taxon within that site and the last is the plant individual. Compartment is either "EN" or "EP"


Column 1 has no name and is an index that was added by a spreadsheet program. 
region_site - the first half of the sample name
region_site_plant - same as above, but with the plant taxon.
X - not useful, detritus
taxon.y - plant taxon. Use taxon_final for this info.
plant - the full sample name, except for compartment
forward and reverse barcode - the barcode (MID) sequence
locus - 16s or ITS
samplename - the whole sample name. Primary refers to if the sample was a technical replicate or not. 
project - this project was split among sequencing runs and so was assigned different project names occasionally. This is mostly useful for tracking samples through the LIMS
wellposition - self-explanatory
plate - which plate the sample was on
midplate - which plate of mids was used for that plate
substrate - should all be plant. We originally had soil data, but decided not to use them. 
Client_name - my name, left over from the sequencing labs metadata
combo - a convenience field where all the sample name parts are combined, for sorting purposes.
area_cm2 - leaf area, measured with imageJ, averaged among leaflets for that sample.
mass_g - leaf mass, averaged among leaflets for that sample. 
mass_extracted - how much mass made it through extraction. Note that some leaves were too small to be exdtracted by themselves so this number can be larger than leaf mass.
leaves_extracted - the number of leaves that were extracted.
exdtractionFailed - did the extraction not work well or not
rewashed - yes/no whether or not this sample was rewashed to determine how well the washing treatment worked.
leaf_broken - yes/no if a large leaf was broken for extraction.
slaOnly - detritus, ignore.
notes.x - notes, ignore.
startTime - sampling start time, only available for a few samples. 
xcoord - ycoord - where in the plot the sample was obtained. The plot was a 50 x 50 m square.
sidePlantSampled - the side sampled, if only one side was sampled, which was not common. 
phenology - either fruiting/flowering/vegetative
circumStem - circumference at 1.5 m approximately for trees
width - approximate width of plant
plantMeasurement* - the other dimensions of the plant. Imagine a box that could be put over the plant, these measurements, plus width, would be the dimensions of that box. All thse measurements are in cm. 
height_sampled - how high off the ground was the sample.

NPQt, Phi*, Relative_chlorophyll - multispeq
time - time of sampling
taxon.x - the taxon repeated. This is incomplete, use taxon_final for this info.
thickness - multispeq
thicknessReliable - whether or not the thickness measurements can be trusted. 
absorbance* - absorbance at different wavelengths. multispeq measurement
angle - slope angle of leaf, multispeq
angle direction - which way the sample was pointed, multispeq
B - blueness, multispeq
baseline - multispeq, not sure what this is. 
compass - ignore, multispeq I think
compass direction - ignore, multispeq I think
contactless_temparature - temperature of the leaf, multispeq
detector_read1 - unknown, multispeq
ecs* - multispeq
flatten_slope, Fm* and Fo* - multispeq

*MPF* - multispeq
pitch and pressure - multispeq
ql, qp, R, ratio* - multispeq
Rel_chl_intensity - multispeq
Rfd, roll, SPAD* - multispeq
temperature - multispeq
TiemofDay - multispeq, ignoreable
vH - multispeq
User - multispeq
Device.ID - multispeq
Latitude and longitude -multispeq ignore, use lat and long
Issues - multispeq
photo - mostly NA
status - multispeq, whether submitted to their repository
waterRetention - angle at which water drops off leaf. 
toughness - measured with a penetrometer
sameLeaf - if the same leaf was used for the thickness measurements and waterRetention measurements
mtrange - the name of the region
name - the site name
lat long - the lat and long of the site
elev_m - elevation of site
slope_perc - slope percentage
aspect - cardinal direction of the slope
Startday0-365 - start day, mostly left NA
conditions - weather
TimeStart and timeEnd - multispeq
canopyCover - mostly NA
treeRich, shrubRich - the number of species of trees or shrubs observed in the site, whether they were sampled or not. 
notes.y - notes
